File Contents:
1. finalprojectstandinname.ipynb: Data cleaning, training, and testing of our final model. 
2. wiki_titles.csv: Unable to upload to GitHub due to size constraints. Able to send it over email if need be!

Project Goal:
- To create a neural network capable of processing natural language, learning how to make movie titles from movie plots, and generating completely new and believable movie titles that have some correspondance to a given plot.
